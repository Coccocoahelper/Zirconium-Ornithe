# Zirconium
This is an Ornithe port of Eliotex's Zirconium mod, with the following optimizations:

- Chunk saving (from the original Zirconium mod)

- Language reloading (from Mixces' special mod)

- Compact sine lookup table (from Jellysquid's Lithium mod)

- Effect checking by skipping if none are active (from jss2a98aj's BugTorch mod)

Currently requires Java 21 or higher.
